# ðŸª™ CryptoPortfolioTracker

> A simple crypto portfolio tracker I'm building as part of my learning journey in .NET and software development. This project is still in progress and being updated regularly as I learn new things.

## ðŸš€ Project Goal

This application is mainly a personal learning project. I'm using it to practice and explore topics such as:

- ASP.NET Core (.NET 6 / 7 / 8)
- Entity Framework Core
- Database connections and CRUD operations
- Git & GitHub workflows
- Structuring a real-world project
- (Optional) Building a simple UI or API
